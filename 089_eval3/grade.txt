Testing ./cyoa-step1 story1/page1.txt 
Your file matched the expected output
Testing ./cyoa-step1 story1/page8.txt 
Your file matched the expected output
Testing ./cyoa-step1 story1/page11.txt 
Your file matched the expected output

Step 2
Checking that cyoa-step2 compiles
rm -f *~ *.o
g++ -ggdb3 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu++98 -o cyoa-step2 cyoa-step2.cpp cyoa.cpp page.cpp story.cpp
Testing ./cyoa-step2 story1 2\n1\n
Your file matched the expected output
Testing ./cyoa-step2 story1 1\n4\n1\n3\n
Your file matched the expected output

Step 3
Checking that cyoa-step3 compiles
rm -f *~ *.o
g++ -ggdb3 -Wall -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu++98 -o cyoa-step3 cyoa-step3.cpp cyoa.cpp page.cpp story.cpp
Testing ./cyoa-step3 story1 
Your file matched the expected output
Testing ./cyoa-step3 cycle 
Your file matched the expected output

Step 4
Checking that cyoa-step4 compiles
rm -f *~ *.o
make: 'cyoa-step4' is up to date.
Testing ./cyoa-step4 one_win 
Your file matched the expected output
Testing ./cyoa-step4 story1
Your output matched the expected output

Step 1: PASSED
Step 2: PASSED
Step 3: PASSED

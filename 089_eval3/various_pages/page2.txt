One bright weekend afternoon, you decide to adventure, putting on your Ring
of the Niebelungen and traveler's cloak and strapping the famed sword Ice
to your back.

Half-way up the mountain Matterhorn, you see a cave opening with steam
coming out. You enter the cave and tiptoe inside, straining your eyes in
the gloomy mist.

You encounter a dragon.
